#Overview

The **bioAPI** is a bioinformatics tool designed to process, analyze, and manipulate genomic data. It supports operations such as sequence extraction, GC content calculation, k-mer indexing, FASTA/FASTQ file handling, and more. The program is implemented in C++ and provides a command-line interface for interacting with genomic data.

#Features

##FASTA/FASTQ File Handling:

- Load and process genomic sequences from FASTA and FASTQ files.
- Count sequences in MULTIFASTA files.
- Extract sequences between start and stop codons.
- Filter FASTQ files based on quality.

##Sequence Analysis:

- Calculate GC content.
- Identify degenerate bases.
- Calculate average sequence quality.

##Sequence Manipulation:

- Generate complementary and reverse-complementary sequences.
- Remove poly-A/poly-T tails.
- Remove sequence prefixes.

##Indexing and Pattern Matching:

- Build suffix and LCP (Longest Common Prefix) tables.
- Search for patterns in sequences.
- Find repeated patterns.
- Map reads to the genome using k-mers.

##Command-Line Interface:

Supports multiple options for processing and analyzing genomic data.
Provides detailed usage instructions.
